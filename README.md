This mod censors players with invisibility in death messages.  
Server-side, client-side optional but it will have death message localised (instead of death.attack.player.invisible); you can also fix it with vanilla damage, see below  
Depends on Fabric API, Fabric Language Kotlin; you should have those already.  
\>=1.20.3 versions coming soonâ„¢

Since 1.1 version of mod, config file `invisible-deity-damage-type.txt` can be used to change damage to be applied by invisible players. This will fix localisation issue if it matters to you. Docs inside config.
